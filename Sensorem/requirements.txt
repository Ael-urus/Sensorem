# This file lists project dependencies found by scanning source code.
# Generated using AST parsing and filtering built-in/standard library modules.
# Generated by requirements.py
#
# To install these dependencies, it's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
# With a virtual environment activated, run:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Note:
# - Versions are based on 'pip freeze' from the environment where this script was run.
# - Modules not found in 'pip freeze' (potentially local project modules or complex package name mismatches)
#   are listed without versions.
# - Mapping of import names (e.g., 'sklearn') to package names (e.g., 'scikit-learn')
#   is attempted but may not be perfect for all packages.
#
